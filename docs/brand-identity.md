The Daybreak Cleaning logo consists of two parts:

1. **Icon: Color Stripe Mark**
   - Four vertical stripes representing the colors of daybreak/sunrise
   - Simple, modern geometric design
   - Works at multiple sizes (from favicon to full logo)

2. **Wordmark: "DAYBREAK CLEANING"**
   - Clean, sans-serif typography
   - Two-word lockup with "DAYBREAK" as primary, "CLEANING" as secondary
   - Bold weight suggests professionalism and reliability

### Color Palette

**Primary Brand Colors (The "Daybreak Gradient"):**

```
Yellow/Amber:  #FBB024  (Stripe 1)

Purple:        #9333EA  (Stripe 4)
