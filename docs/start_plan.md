# Context: Kyle Johnson – Exploring SmartCooler Business

## Who I Am
- Kyle Johnson, former Meta data scientist turned entrepreneur.
- Background: Columbia CS & Statistics, 7+ years in data/AI roles.
- Current focus: running AI-powered startups (Call Compass, Riff, Takeout, etc.) under Tidewater Research.
- Looking to diversify into **non-tech, service-based businesses** that generate cash flow and can scale.

## What I'm Considering
- Traditional trades (HVAC, restoration, etc.) are attractive but require long apprenticeships and licensing (3+ years).
- I want to stay in **entrepreneur mode**: pitching, operating, and scaling businesses without first being an employee.
- Inspired by a YouTube video on **SmartCoolers** (next-gen vending machines):
  - Look like sleek fridges for upscale locations (apartments, gyms, urgent cares).
  - Cashless payments + inventory tracking built in.
  - Operators can finance machines (no large upfront risk).
  - Scale comes from signing property contracts, not years of licensing.

## Why SmartCoolers Make Sense for Me
- Keeps me in **business operator mode**, not apprenticeship mode.
- Low barrier to entry, with financing and contracts-first strategy.
- Aligns with my strengths: sales pitches, systems/processes, data-driven optimization.
- Provides optionality: cash flow now, future ability to invest in real estate, trades, or other businesses.

## Path to First Cooler in the Field

### 1. Legitimacy Basics
- Form LLC + EIN + business bank account.
- Register domain + professional email (Google Workspace).
- Simple 1-page website with logo and copy.
- Liability insurance ($500–$1,500/yr).

### 2. Sales & Collateral
- One-page pitch deck (PDF) with cooler photo mockup.
- Branded polo or t-shirt for site visits.
- Business cards for property manager meetings.

### 3. Operations Infrastructure
- Stripe/Square account (if cooler vendor doesn’t fully handle payments).
- Spreadsheet or Airtable for inventory tracking (early stage).
- Wholesale accounts (Costco/BJ’s to start; later Sysco/US Foods).
- Storage space (garage or small unit).

### 4. Equipment & Vendors
- Partner with a SmartCooler provider (Byte, Vengo, etc.).
- Finance equipment (usually $3K–$10K per cooler).

### 5. Customer Support Setup
- Support email + Google Voice line.
- Simple service agreement template (you install, stock, maintain).

### 6. Expansion
- Land 1–2 pilot locations (upscale apartment lobby, urgent care, gym).
- Learn product mix preferences per site.
- Replicate process → 5, 10, 20+ machines.
- Optional: revenue share with property managers for stickiness.
